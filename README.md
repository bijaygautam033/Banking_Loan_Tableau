# Banking_Loan_Tableau
This is my internship project on loan analytics and I have generated the insights of banking loan in tableau public by using various KPI's like Total Loan, Total Collection, total Disbursement, Total Outstanding and other parameters.

# About Project:

# Tools Used:

# Problem Statement:

* Stakeholders wanted to know the status of total loan,total collection,total disbursement and total outstanding that the bank has provided to its customers.
* Count of the customers by the grade.
* Count of customers by ownership.
* Count of customers by term wise.
* Status of Good vs Bad loan.

# Analyses:

* Generated the insights of all the summary of KPI's using the **Calculated field** in tableau worksheets.
